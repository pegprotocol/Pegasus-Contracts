# Welcome To Pegasus

Pegasus is an elastic supply token at its core, offering a governance model for users to vote on tools to either be created or forked from other existing ecosystems onto the Binance Smart Chain. Some examples of our tools include forks of Tornado cash, PNL \(profit & loss\) dashboards, price oracles & more. 

We are a community run project that are governed by vote of the community for all major changes to the protocol. Business strategy and overall development is ultimately decided on by our developers and team.  
  
The Pegasus ecosystem will focus on the following core products:

* Ethereum Project Forks 
* PNL UI & Dashboards
* Dynamic Price Oracles 

Each of these serve a different purpose within the ecosystem and aim to make the Binance Smart Chain more efficient & user friendly.
