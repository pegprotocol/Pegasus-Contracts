# Governance

Pegasus is a community focused protocol that will take input from the community. Each voter participating in governance selecting the winning proposol will be airdropped a small portion of peg tokens. This further incentivizes honest voting and removes bias of users blindly voting on undesireable ideas. Each time a proposition has more votes over another it will be bumped up in the schedule to be completed. Propositions at the bottom of the stack will be burned and discredited from future events and a new idea will be introduced.
