# Governance

Pegasus is a community focused protocol that will take input from the community. Each voter participating in governance selecting the winning proposal will be airdropped a small portion of peg tokens. This method gives incentives to honest voting and removes bias of users blindly voting on unfavourable ideas. Each time a proposition has more votes over another it will be bumped up in the schedule to be completed. Propositions at the bottom of the stack will be burned and discredited from future voting and a new idea will be introduced. In the future it is possible we add more strategies to the governance model including proposals focused towards our core token model.

The main purpose of our governance system is to:

☑ Incentivize token holding

☑ Incentivize tech development and new open-source dApps

☑ Incentivize governance participation
