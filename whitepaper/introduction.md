  We believe a "whitepaper" should be easy to read and simply help you
  understand how the project works. We hope the following information provides
  that. Let's start with the basics.

# Introduction

_**Pegasus Token**_  
Pegasus at its core is a fork of the popular decentralized finance rebase projects such as Ampleforth & Ditto Money which use the elastic supply model. We plan introduce liquidity staking in the future for the usage of our tools on the Binance Smart Chain.

_**What is a rebase?**_  
The goal of Pegasus is to maintain a stable price of around $1. To achieve this there are daily supply adjustments called “Rebases”. Rebases are done in such a way that users’ proportional holdings aren’t diluted: A rebase changes every wallet balance by the same amount while also instantly increasing or decreasing the token price on decentralized exchanges.

_**When is a rebase?**_  
Rebase can be triggered via our dashboard up to six times a day OR every 4 hours.  
The rebase has to be activated manually via the “Rebase” BUTTON.

_**Who can trigger a rebase?**_  
Everybody. First come first serve!  
Once a rebase is activated it will affect all wallet balances.  
The cooldown on the dashboard will reset to 4h.

_**Rebase Formula:**_  
\(1≤+PD/5   OR  1≤-PD/2_**\)**_  
Positive rebase adjusts by price difference / 5.  
E.g. if the price is $1.10 the rebase is +2%.  
Negative rebase adjusts by price difference / 2.  
E.g. If price is $0.90, rebase = -5%.

_**Types of Rebases:**_  
Positive rebase above $1.06 \(supply will increase\)  
Negative rebase below $0,96 \(supply will decrease\)  
Neutral rebase in a price range of $0,96 — $1.06 \(this means that the supply will not change\)
